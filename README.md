We consider the problem of reachability analysis from noisy data given that the system 
model is unknown. Identifying a model is a preliminary step in the state of the art 
reachability analysis approaches. However, systems are becoming more complex and data 
is becoming more readily available.<br />

## Running 
1- Download [CORA](https://github.com/TUMcps/CORA) and [MPT](https://www.mpt3.org) toolboxs.<br />.
<br />
2- Add CORA nad MPT folder and subfolders to the Matlab path.  <br />
3- run t_linearDT.m for linear system<br />
4- run t_nonlinearDT.m for nonlinear system<br />
