## Problem Statement
We consider the problem of reachability analysis from noisy data, given that the system model is unknown. 
Identifying a model is a preliminary step in the state-of-the-art reachability analysis approaches. 
However, systems are becoming more complex, and data is becoming more readily available. 
We propose a data-driven reachability analysis using matrix zonotope and using a new set representation named constrained matrix zonotope.<br />
The following figure summarizes the idea behind our papers.

## Files Description 
There are two levels of complexity for the proposed data driven reachability analysis<br />
A- Basic reachability analysis under the folder examples-basic<br /><br />
B- Advanced reachability analysis using constrained matrix zonotope under the folder examples-cmz.
These files compare three methods for reachability analysis namely, matrix zonotope, constrained matrix
zonotop using exact noise description and constrained matrix zonotope given side information.<br />
<br />

## Running 
1- Download [CORA 2020](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/pages/archive/v2020/index.html) and [MPT](https://www.mpt3.org) toolboxs.<br />
2- Add CORA and MPT folder and subfolders to the Matlab path.  <br />
3- Add the repo folder and subfolders to the Matlab path.  <br />
<br />
<br />
## Basix reachablity under the folder examples-basic:<br />
1- run a_linearDT.m for linear system using matrix zonotope.<br />
2- run a_nonlinearDT.m for nonlinear system.<br />
3- run a_polyDT.m for polynomial system using matrix zonotope.<br />
<br />
<br />
## Advanced reachablity under the folder examples-cmz:<br />
1- run b_linearDT_measnoise.m for linear system with measurement noise.<br />
2- run b_linearDT_sideInfo.m for linear system given side information.<br />
3- run b_polyDT_sideInfo.m for polynomial system given side information.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can save the workspace after any advanced reachability file (folder examples-cmz) and then run the plotting 
file under the folder plotting.<br />
For example, run<br />
b_linearDT_sideInfo.m<br />
save the workspace and load it later then run<br />
p_plot_linearDT_sideInfo.m<br />
<br />
<br />
